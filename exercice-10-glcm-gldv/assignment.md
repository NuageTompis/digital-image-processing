## Task

> Please transform 4-valued images from your favourite image and calculate GLCM and GLDV.

Here is the image I chose along the 4-valued version of it (which I obtained using an online tool).

| Original                                       | 4-valued                                           |

I then wrote a python script to compute the GLCM and GLDV of my image (which you may find on my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/NuageTompis/digital-image-processing)). I obtained the following matrices:
